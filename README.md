### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on RNCP Level 7 Data and Database Architecture at 42Paris.

ðŸŒ± These are the works I've done.
- [Libft](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/libft)
  - Introduction: I started with creating a C language library as my first project. It was an exercise in reinventing the wheel, creating a library with limited functions.
  - Example: Implemented a function similar to C's strlen but named ft_strlen, without using the original strlen.
  - Impact: These functions were useful in later assignments, feeling like acquiring new tools in an RPG.
  - Learning: Covered basics of C, header files, Makefiles, coding standards, and handling edge cases. Learning was more through self-discovery and collaboration than direct teaching.
- [Get Next Line](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/get_next_line)
  - Project: Developed a function in C named get_next_line to read a file line by line, enhancing understanding of file handling in C. Printf Reimplementation
  - Challenge: Reimplemented the printf function, a step up in difficulty.
  - Features: Supported various flags, length modifiers, and conversion specifiers, including precise handling of floating-point rounding.
  - Learning: This project highlighted the complexities of building larger programs.
- [Inception](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/inception) 
  - Project: Docker Study. Created an environment with nginx, mysql, wordpress using Docker, learning about creating consistent programming environments across different systems.
  - Challenge: Creating Docker image from scratch. Initially found environmental setup tasks challenging but eventually became more comfortable with Docker.
ls Command

- [Libasm](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/libasm)
  - Scope: Learned Assembly language, focusing on implementing very basic functions permitted in the initial C library project.
  - Insight: Gained insights into foundational aspects of programming, deeper than basic C.

- [Minishell](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/minishell)
  - Project: Created a shell in C, a team assignment.
  - Scope: Involved implementing various functionalities, process creation, inter-process communication, and ensuring robustness to various inputs.

- [Philosophers](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/philo)
  - Concept: Studied the dining philosophers problem, an analogy often used in parallel processing.
  - Scope: Involved threads and concurrent processing, but was less extensive than minishell.

- [C++ Module (CPP-module)](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/cpp)
  - Approach: Completed numerous small assignments to learn the basics of C++.

- Web Serv
  - Concept: nginx Reimplementation. Reimplemented nginx using C++, a team project.
  - Learning: Focused on understanding and implementing the intricacies of web server functionality and protocols.

- Transcendence
  - Concept: Developed a comprehensive web application capable of gaming and chatting, in a 5-person team.
  - Technologies: Utilized TypeScript, NestJS for the backend, and NextJS for the frontend.
  - Challenge: Combined all previously learned skills and required researching and implementing necessary technologies from scratch.
