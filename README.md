### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on RNCP Level 7 Data and Database Architecture at 42Paris.

ðŸŒ± These are the works I've done.
- [Libft](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/libft)
  - Introduction: I started with creating a C language library as my first project. It was an exercise in reinventing the wheel, creating a library with limited functions.
  - Example: Implemented a function similar to C's strlen but named ft_strlen, without using the original strlen.
  - Impact: These functions were useful in later assignments, feeling like acquiring new tools in an RPG.
  - Learning: Covered basics of C, header files, Makefiles, coding standards, and handling edge cases. Learning was more through self-discovery and collaboration than direct teaching.
- Get Next Line
Project: Developed a function in C named get_next_line to read a file line by line, enhancing understanding of file handling in C.
Printf Reimplementation
Challenge: Reimplemented the printf function, a step up in difficulty.
Features: Supported various flags, length modifiers, and conversion specifiers, including precise handling of floating-point rounding.
Learning: This project highlighted the complexities of building larger programs.
Docker Study
Project: Created an environment with nginx, mysql, wordpress using Docker, learning about creating consistent programming environments across different systems.
Challenge: Initially found environmental setup tasks challenging but eventually became more comfortable with Docker.
ls Command
Nature: An event-based project, not a main assignment.
Implementation: Implemented some functionalities of the ls command.
Learning: Focused on improving README writing skills during this period.
Assembly
Scope: Learned Assembly language, focusing on implementing very basic functions permitted in the initial C library project.
Insight: Gained insights into foundational aspects of programming, deeper than basic C.
Algorithm Study
Task: Developed programs to optimize sorting within certain constraints, requiring understanding and application of sorting algorithms in specific scenarios.
Minishell
Project: Created a shell in C, a team assignment.
Scope: Involved implementing various functionalities, process creation, inter-process communication, and ensuring robustness to various inputs.
Philosophers
Concept: Studied the dining philosophers problem, an analogy often used in parallel processing.
Scope: Involved threads and concurrent processing, but was less extensive than minishell.
Network Study
Focus: Shifted from theoretical network study to practical application, like setting up port numbers.
C++ Module (CPP-module)
Approach: Completed numerous small assignments to learn the basics of C++.
nginx Reimplementation
Task: Reimplemented nginx using C++, a team project.
Learning: Focused on understanding and implementing the intricacies of web server functionality and protocols.
Docker Compose Study
Advancement: Moved from individual Docker implementations to using Docker Compose, dealing with more complex network configurations and practical setups.
Web Application Development
Final Project: Developed a comprehensive web application capable of gaming and chatting, in a 5-person team.
Technologies: Utilized TypeScript, NestJS for the backend, and NextJS for the frontend.
Challenge: Combined all previously learned skills and required researching and implementing necessary technologies from scratch.
