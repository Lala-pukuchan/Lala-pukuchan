### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on RNCP Level 7 Data and Database Architecture at 42Paris.

- [ML_Module](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/ML_Module)
  - Contents: Modules for Supervised Learning such as linear regression and Logistic Regression. The modules systematically progress from performing vectorized calculations to implementing ridge regression, a technique that helps prevent overfitting. This cource is created based on [this cource on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
- [ft_linear_regression](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/ft_linear_regression)
  - Contents: Implementation of Gradient Descent Model for linear regression.
- [dslr](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/dslr)
  - Contents: Visualizing data for selecting the useful input data for training the model. Implementation of Gradient Descent Model for logistic Regression. Also, Mini-Batch and Stochastic Gradient Descent models are implemented.

- [Camagru](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/camagru)
  - Contents: Implementation of Instagram like Web application with Php.

ðŸŒ± These are the works I've done in Common Core.
- [Libft](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/libft)
  - Contents: I started with creating a C language library as my first project. It was an exercise in reinventing the wheel, creating a library with limited functions.
  - Example: Implemented a function similar to C's strlen but named ft_strlen, without using the original strlen.

- [Get Next Line](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/get_next_line)
  - Contents: Developed a function in C named get_next_line to read a file line by line, enhancing understanding of file handling in C. Printf Reimplementation

- [Printf](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/ft_printf)
  - Contents: Reimplemented the printf function, a step up in difficulty.
  - Features: Supported various flags, length modifiers, and conversion specifiers, including precise handling of floating-point rounding.

- [Minishell](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/minishell)
  - Contents: Created a shell in C, a team assignment.
  - Scope: Involved implementing various functionalities, process creation, inter-process communication, and ensuring robustness to various inputs.

- [Philosophers](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/philo)
  - Contents: Studied the dining philosophers problem, an analogy often used in parallel processing.
  - Scope: Involved threads and concurrent processing, but was less extensive than minishell.

- [C++ Module (CPP-module)](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/cpp)
  - Contents: Completed numerous small assignments to learn the basics of C++.

- [Web Serv](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/WebServ)
  - Contents: nginx Reimplementation. Reimplemented nginx using C++, a team project.
  - Learning: Focused on understanding and implementing the intricacies of web server functionality and protocols.

- [Inception](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/inception) 
  - Contents: Created an environment with nginx, mysql, wordpress using Docker, learning about creating consistent programming environments across different systems.
  - Technologies: Docker
  - Challenge: Creating Docker image from scratch. Initially found environmental setup tasks challenging but eventually became more comfortable with Docker.

- [Transcendence](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/transcendence)
  - Contents: Developed a comprehensive web application capable of gaming and chatting, in a 3-person team.
  - Technologies: Utilized NestJS, Prisma for the backend, and React for the frontend.
  - Challenge: Combined all previously learned skills and required researching and implementing necessary technologies from scratch.
 
- [Libasm](https://github.com/Lala-pukuchan/libasm)
  - Contents: Learned Assembly language, focusing on implementing very basic functions permitted in the initial C library project.
  - Insight: Gained insights into foundational aspects of programming, deeper than basic C.
